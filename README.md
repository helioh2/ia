# Artificial Intelligence Assignments

Some code done during an Artificial Intelligence discipline taken in my PhD. 

The projects are:

- a tile-based puzzle game solved with A* using different strategies.
- a machine-learning problem developed with both fuzzy logic and neural networks
- a try of solving the Sudoku problem with local search (it was more experimental, it was not effective)
